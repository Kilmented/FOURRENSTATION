// Multiple flavors of GUN.
// Here's the types.
// /obj/item/gun/ballistic/automatic // basically comes down to "a semi and or automatic"
// /obj/item/gun/ballistic/rifle // basically comes down to "hit activate once to eject twice to cock between every shot"
// /obj/item/gun/ballistic/shotgun // basically comes down to "hit activate to cock and eject between every shot"
// /obj/item/gun/ballistic/revolver // basically comes down to "a semi but hit activate to drop the whole cylinder"
// That's all the relevant ones. Enjoy.
// Anyways, here's probably what you were looking for. The order is; Defines, Guns, magazines, and -at the very bottom- casings and then projectiles. Take care. - Jaeger

// Happy 100th PR, Warrenstation!
